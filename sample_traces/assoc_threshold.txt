# Associativity threshold demonstration
# Config: 256B cache, 16B blocks = 16 blocks
# Expected results (with default config):
#   Direct-Mapped:     0% hit rate  (3 blocks thrash on index 0)
#   2-way Set-Assoc:   0% hit rate  (3 blocks thrash in 2-way set)
#   4-way Set-Assoc:   50% hit rate (3 blocks fit in 4-way set)
#   Fully Associative: 50% hit rate (3 blocks fit easily)
#
# Shows the "threshold effect" of associativity:
# 3 conflicting blocks need at least 3-way associativity to avoid thrashing.
