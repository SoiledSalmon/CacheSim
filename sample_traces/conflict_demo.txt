# Conflict miss demonstration trace
# This trace shows how direct-mapped caches suffer from conflict misses
# while fully associative caches avoid them

# For a cache with:
# - 256 bytes total, 16 bytes per block = 16 blocks
# - Direct-mapped: addresses 0x000 and 0x100 map to same index

# Initial accesses
0x000 R
0x010 R
0x020 R
0x030 R

# These addresses conflict with the above in direct-mapped
# (assuming 16-block cache with 16-byte blocks)
0x100 R
0x110 R
0x120 R
0x130 R

# Re-access original addresses - will miss in DM, may hit in FA/SA
0x000 R
0x010 R
0x020 R
0x030 R

# Re-access conflicting addresses - will miss in DM, may hit in FA/SA
0x100 R
0x110 R
0x120 R
0x130 R
