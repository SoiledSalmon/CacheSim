# Conflict miss demonstration trace
# Config: 256B cache, 16B blocks = 16 blocks
# Expected results (with default config):
#   Direct-Mapped:     0% hit rate  (16 misses)
#   Fully Associative: 50% hit rate (8 hits, 8 misses)
#   4-way Set-Assoc:   50% hit rate (8 hits, 8 misses)
#
# This trace shows how direct-mapped caches suffer from conflict misses
# while fully associative and set-associative caches avoid them.
# Addresses 0x000 and 0x100 map to the same DM index (index 0).

# Initial accesses (cold misses)
0x000 R
0x010 R
0x020 R
0x030 R

# These addresses conflict with the above in direct-mapped
# (same index bits, different tag bits)
0x100 R
0x110 R
0x120 R
0x130 R

# Re-access original addresses — MISS in DM, HIT in FA/SA
0x000 R
0x010 R
0x020 R
0x030 R

# Re-access conflicting addresses — MISS in DM, HIT in FA/SA
0x100 R
0x110 R
