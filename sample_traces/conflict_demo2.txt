# Conflict demo 2 — All addresses map to the SAME DM index
# Config: 256B cache, 16B blocks = 16 blocks
# Expected results (with default config):
#   Direct-Mapped:     0% hit rate  (every access evicts the previous)
#   Fully Associative: 50% hit rate (4 unique blocks fit easily)
#   4-way Set-Assoc:   50% hit rate (4 blocks fit in a 4-way set)
#
# Block size = 16 bytes, offset bits = 4
# These addresses differ only in tag bits, all mapping to DM index 0.
