# Sequential access pattern — demonstrates spatial locality
# Config: 256B cache, 16B blocks
# Expected: All architectures produce identical results (no conflicts)
#   Working set fits in cache; spatial locality gives high hit rate
#
# Good for demonstrating how block size affects hit rate:
# try block_size=4 vs block_size=16 to see the difference.

# Sequential byte accesses within first block (0x00-0x0F)
0x00 R
0x01 R
0x02 R
0x03 R

# Sequential byte accesses within second block (0x10-0x1F)
0x10 R
0x11 R
0x12 R
0x13 R

# Go back to first block — should hit
0x04 R
0x05 R
0x06 R
0x07 R

# Sequential word accesses in third block (0x20-0x2F)
0x20 R
0x24 R
0x28 R
0x2C R

# Strided access pattern (every 16 bytes = one new block each)
0x40 R
0x50 R
0x60 R
0x70 R
0x80 R
0x90 R
0xA0 R
0xB0 R
