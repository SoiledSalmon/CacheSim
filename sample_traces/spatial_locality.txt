# Spatial locality demonstration
# Config: 256B cache, 16B blocks
# Expected: All architectures produce identical results
#   All accesses are within one block (0x0040-0x004F)
#   First access = cold miss, rest = hits (87.5% hit rate)
#
# Shows that once a block is loaded, nearby addresses are "free"
